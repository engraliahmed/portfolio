# Why RAG is the Future

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is more than just a buzzword. For an AI Researcher, it represents the bridge between static model knowledge and dynamic real-world data.

<CodeWindow filename="file.py">

```python
def hello_rag():
    print("Optimizing RAG Pipelines...")
    print("Optimizing RAG Pipelines...")
    print("Optimizing RAG Pipelines...")
    print("Optimizing RAG Pipelines...")
    print("Optimizing RAG Pipelines...")
```

</CodeWindow>

### My Key Findings:
- Synthetic data pipelines improve retrieval accuracy by 40%.
- Hybrid search is superior to pure vector search for niche technical domains.
